## Hey, I'm Sean Payne.

I am a senior software engineer at Autify, working on automating software testing for mobile apps.<br/>
I'm currently learning Rust and it's quickly becoming my favorite language. I primarily work with Go (pretty solid) and Ruby-On-Rails (pretty awful) for my job. I've previously coded with Python, C++, C, and once upon a time, Java.<br/>

I'm working with my friend @morganhein on a (soon to be) open-source IMAP/POP3/SMTP email management tool which is meant to fill a gap in servicing protonmail.

Previously, I've fixed bugs in the open source reimplementation of Roller Coaster Tycoon and to co-created an educational app about climate change. My biggest priority in development is creating easy to read, maintainable code.
